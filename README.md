## YAVSRG

My latest attempt at managing a project with several parts that need their own release streams but are developed together in one place on my machine (I am sick of both monorepos and submodules for many reasons)

Run `clone-repos.sh` to clone all repos relevant to YAVSRG, and then the solution file is set up so you can open the entire project as one solution in your IDE of choice
