### What is YAVSRG?

YET ANOTHER VERTICALLY SCROLLING RHYTHM GAME is my collection of rhythm game projects full of the features and ideas I think make games of this genre fun to play.

The project is centred around my custom rhythm game client, **Interlude**, and the tooling around it.

Visit [yavsrg.net](https://www.yavsrg.net) to read more about this project and its features.

<h2 align="center">üéÆ Playing the game</h2>

Various player guides, including a wiki, are built into the game to help you get started, especially if you're coming from another popular rhythm game client.  
You can also [check out the wiki here](https://www.yavsrg.net/interlude/wiki) in your browser!

**On Windows** - Download the latest release [from the website](https://www.yavsrg.net), extract it and play!  
**On macOS and Linux** - You currently must build the game from source, I've made this quick and easy, see below

<h2 align="center">üß± Building Interlude</h2>

> [!Note]
>
> If you just want to play the game on Windows, **you do *not* need to do this**, instead get the game by downloading the latest release from the site

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [the .NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)  
Follow the install instructions for both of these for your platform

2. Clone the repository and set up the CLI tool

	To do this via a terminal:
	```bash
	# Navigate to somewhere you want to store the interlude codebase - Don't forget --recurse-submodules!
	git clone https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG.git --recurse-submodules
	# Setup the `yavsrg` CLI tool
	cd YAVSRG/tools
	dotnet pack
	dotnet tool install -g --add-source ./nupkg YAVSRG.CLI
	```
	**If you have never installed a dotnet tool**, after the final step you will likely see a message in your terminal about your dotnet tool location not being added to PATH, with a command to fix it.  
	If so, also do that.

	The steps above should set up the `yavsrg` CLI command. Try running `yavsrg version`, you should see a version number in the terminal.  
	**If this hasn't worked and you are stuck, get assistance in [the discord](https://yavsrg.net/discord)**

3. Run `yavsrg play` to build and play the latest version.  
   From now on `yavsrg play` will launch the game when you want to play.  
    To update your game when a new version comes out, run `yavsrg update`.
	
To later uninstall the `yavsrg` command line tool, run `dotnet tool uninstall --global yavsrg.cli`  
After that you can delete the entire YAVSRG folder to entirely remove the game and all data from your system.

<h2 align="center">üß± Building Interlude <code style="color: red; font-size: 20px">&lt;for developers only&gt;</code></h2>

> [!Note]

> If the setup guide for non-developers on Linux/macOS didn't work, please **do not try these steps** and instead get assistance in [the discord](https://yavsrg.net/discord) if all you want to do is play.

Developers should first follow the non-developer setup and ensure the `yavsrg` CLI tool works.  
Use `yavsrg debug_run` to build and test the current branch - You should run this at least once before building via an IDE.

After the first use of `yavsrg debug_run`, you should have the correct BASS .dll/.dynlib/.so files for your platform placed in YAVSRG/interlude/src/bin/Debug/net8.0  
If not, the game will let you know on launch - Look for them here https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG/tree/main/engine/lib (you need both the main and the fx one)
If your platform isn't there contact me in the discord or search online for it

If you open YAVSRG.sln in [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), setting Interlude as the active project will let you simply build and run with F5 which is my current workflow.

While Interlude stores all its data in the same folder as the exe by default, you can change that to a specific location - In YAVSRG/interlude/src/bin/Debug/net8.0/config.json you can edit `WorkingDirectory` to whatever is convenient

I use `"C:/Interlude/dev"` on Windows  
If you previously built Interlude as a non-developer, setting it to `"../../../../../GAME"` means both builds share data  
If you previously installed Interlude somewhere else, setting it to that path means both copies share data
