# YAVSRG code style guidelines

### Branch naming

I don't know a best practice for what to name your branches  
Would recommend matching the primary branch on the original repo unless I see a better naming scheme idea

### Commit messages

I like to put emoji in commit messages  
You don't have to care about them in PRs I can just squash with an emoji commit message

🎓 = Localisation changes

🌸 = UI improvement

👽️ = Bug fix

✨ = New user-facing feature

🧱 = New codebase feature/feature otherwise not reaching all users

⚙️ = Developer tooling

⚡️ = CI pipelines

📘 = Documentation, wikis

🏷️ = Releases

💚 = Community content & Automated commits

### Code formatting/style

Try to follow [default F# guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/style-guide/)  
A lot of the style in the codebase all over the place so don't worry about it too deeply - I will add more guidelines if needed later
