# YAVSRG code style guidelines

### Branch naming

I would just name them 'main' to match the central repo

### Commit messages

I like to put emoji in commit messages  
You don't have to care about them in PRs I can just squash with an emoji commit message

🎓 = Localisation changes

🌸 = UI improvement

👽️ = Bug fix

✨ = New user-facing feature

🧱 = New codebase feature/feature otherwise not reaching all users

⚙️ = Developer tooling

⚡️ = CI pipelines

📘 = Documentation, wikis

🏷️ = Releases

💚 = Community content & Automated commits

### Code formatting/style

Try to follow the existing format style, but there will soon be a script to run Fantomas formatting on all code so don't worry and just submit the PR :)  

Prefer `snake_case` variable names over `camelCase`
