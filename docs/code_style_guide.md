# YAVSRG code style guidelines

### Code style, PRs and other such things
- If unsure what to name your branch, I would leave it as 'main' (but I'm open to suggestions)
- At the moment I review all PRs, with an eye to help you understand what changes need to be made if any
- Prefer `snake_case` variable names over `camelCase`
- There will soon be a script to run automatic indentation/formatting on all code - hence don't think to deeply about this kind of thing and just submit the PR :)  

### Commit messages

I like to put emoji in commit messages  
You don't have to care about them - in PRs I can just squash with an emoji commit message
