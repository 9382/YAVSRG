I'm thinking Patreon just because it's the most reliable payment provider (it integrates directly into GitHub too)

Minor hangup for me is what if I want multiple "Patreons" that represent me, Percyqaz, but for various projects (I also make Minecraft plugins)

Ideally find a way to set up patreon so you enter your Interlude username and it automatically gives you the donator badge

### Ideas for possible donator rewards
- You get on the [[Credits]] screen
- That's it for now I think, I love giving out free features for all
