A potentially killer feature where Interlude changes the landscape of VSRGs a little by introducing a YouTube Shorts-style chart recommendation system where you just play what comes up next and that's how your whole session goes

Future ideas:
- Ability to start endless mode from score screen
- Show song title/details on start of play
- Skillset data tracking
- Endless mode should suggest stuff that matches your skillset data in variety mode
- Endless mode should increase skill over time
- Session score meter that increases when you
	- Improve a personal best lamp/score
	- Go up in leaderboard places
	- Increase your table rating
	- Increase your skillset data/rating
	- Play for a certain length of time
- Ability to resume endless mode when leaving not directly through quitting out of next song
