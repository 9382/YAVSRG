A potentially killer feature where Interlude changes the landscape of VSRGs a little by introducing a YouTube Shorts-style chart recommendation system where you just play what comes up next and that's how your whole session goes

Current state: Not bad, using the recommendation algorithm to give you a song immediately on leaving the score screen
## Future features
- Plan your session, have the algorithm drive you towards [[Goals]] like play 5 minutes total of 150bpm chordjack every day

 Would be nifty if the game could preload the next song ahead of time and crossfade it seamlessly
- A UI that gives you stronger control over the picks and what kind of session you want
- Support for playing [[Playlists]] in endless mode
