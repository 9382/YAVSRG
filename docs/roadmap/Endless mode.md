A potentially killer feature where Interlude changes the landscape of VSRGs a little by introducing a YouTube Shorts-style chart recommendation system where you just play what comes up next and that's how your whole session goes

Current state: Not bad, using the recommendation algorithm to give you a song immediately on leaving the score screen
## Future features

Plan your session, have the algorithm drive you towards [[Goals]] like play 5 minutes total of 150bpm chordjack density 8 every day

Would be nifty if the game could preload the next song ahead of time and crossfade it seamlessly

todo: A UI that gives you stronger control over the picks and what kind of session you want
todo: Algorithms that suggests charts on rates such that the suggested rate fits the patterns you were looking for
