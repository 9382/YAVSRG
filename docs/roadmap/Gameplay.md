### [[HUD]] and Playfield features
- Requested: Skinnable images for left and right of the "stage" like in osu!mania
- Requested: [[Chart information widget]] displaying info on the current chart, rate, difficulty, etc (different items toggle-able)
  Useful for streamers or people who forget what they are playing midway
  Also useful for [[Endless mode]] when introducing the next song
- Requested: [[Skinnable judgement indicators]]
  This has taken a while because the list of existing judgements changes depending on your ruleset! This will need to be customisable per-ruleset or per family of similar rulesets
- Requested: More control over explosion animations
  - Control the exact milliseconds the animation lasts for
  - Toggle the fading effect for animated frame animations
