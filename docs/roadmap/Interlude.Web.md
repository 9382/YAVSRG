The web infrastructure for [[Interlude]]

todo: [[Backbeat]] should become part of the main server
as should the [[Noteskins]] repo

Can use B2 to store objects instead of having them in GitHub

There are automated backups in place, currently only once a week

todo: run Integration tests on the server pipeline
Had some issues with it previously not being able to connect due to SSL certificate stuff
