Interlude technically supports multiple languages

Actually having translation files for those languages is another thing though
Could maybe have a look at using Crowdin for this?

For now PRs are welcome providing translated lines for all the English text in the UIs

I also need a tool just for the English stuff
- Ability to highlight a bit of English text, extract it via script to the localisation file and replace with the newly created key
- Ability to verify a key exists/search for similar keys
Goes alongside existing tools

Interlude dev tools should install as a dotnet tool locally so they can be run quickly and often
