### [[HUD]] and Playfield features
- Requested: [[Chart information widget]] displaying info on the current chart, rate, difficulty, etc (different items toggle-able)
  Useful for streamers or people who forget what they are playing midway
  Also useful for [[Endless mode]] when introducing the next song
- Requested: [[Skinnable judgement indicators]]
  This has taken a while because the list of existing judgements changes depending on your ruleset! This will need to be customisable per-ruleset or per family of similar rulesets

Combining HUD config with noteskins:
todo: Move all [[HUD]] configuration to inside Noteskins
todo: You can have textures for specific HUD components that are drawn under the component but after the stage overlays
todo: Implement the judgement stuff
