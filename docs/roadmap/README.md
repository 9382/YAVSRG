# YAVSRG Project Roadmap

Let's turn a new leaf and try this method of todo list tracking, since I seem to constantly gravitate to having a notepad open and just using that

Aim: All of my future action plans for Interlude should exist in one of three forms:
- A GitHub Issue on YAVSRG/YAVSRG (this repository)
- A commented `todo` inline in the source code for tasks that are too small or me-specific to be worth writing up in detail, but not worth forgetting
	All of these can be found by searching for the exact characters `// todo` in .fs and .fsx files
- In this `docs/roadmap` part of the repo, where I can take hopefully more organised notes than GitHub issues

Discussion around these features normally takes place on Discord
