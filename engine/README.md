General purpose game engine built on top of OpenTK for personal projects

## Features
- Precise audio playback/input timing (for rhythm game purposes)
- Some basics around rendering, texture loading and text rendering
- UI engine and handful of basic components

At the moment this project is VERY specific to my particular needs and has no documentation

Someone who discovers this repo may still find it useful to have a look through it
