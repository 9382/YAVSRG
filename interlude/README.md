# **YAVSRG :: Interlude**
The YET ANOTHER VERTICALLY SCROLLING RHYTHM GAME project is a collection of all my ideas on what could be done with VSRGs, brought to life.

This is my custom-made VSRG client, with the aim to put lots of tools, charts and quality of life into one place.

## üéÆ Play it:

Go [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude/releases) for pre-built versions (download and extract the zip, run the exe)

## ü§ù Contributing

Come join [the discord](https://discord.gg/tA22tWR) -- I need YOUR help particularly with playtesting upcoming tables features

## ü§ñ Building it yourself

I have yet to meet someone who wants to do this, so there are no instructions yet

MacOS/Linux builds should work in theory but nobody is desperately asking me for them, which is why they don't exist.

I'll probably add instructions of my own accord once MacOS/Linux builds have been asked for and added to the release pipeline.
