# **YAVSRG: Interlude**
### Yet Another Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game

Read about what this is [on the fancy Github page](https://percyqaz.github.io/YAVSRG)

### Building it yourself

Instructions coming soon (once I have a build for each platform)

You will need:
- Un4seen bass libraries for your platform
- Some fonts and other stuff that aren't in the repo

MacOS/Linux build should work in theory, so with enough requests I can properly start doing cross-platform support/releases

Go [here](https://github.com/percyqaz/YAVSRG/releases) for pre-built versions (works out of box on Windows)
You also need [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1/runtime) installed

### Licenses and stuff

Interlude is licensed under GPLv3.
The audio library used is [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) and requires a license for commercial use (just so you know).
