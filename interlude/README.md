# **YAVSRG :: Interlude**
The YET ANOTHER VERTICALLY SCROLLING RHYTHM GAME project is a collection of all my ideas on what could be done with VSRGs, brought to life.

This is my custom-made VSRG client, with the aim to put lots of tools, charts and quality of life into one place.

## üéÆ Play it for yourself:

Go [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude/releases) for pre-built versions (download and extract the zip, run the exe)

If the game doesn't launch, **MAKE SURE [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1/runtime) is installed!**

## ü§ù Contributing

Come join [the discord](https://discord.gg/tA22tWR) -- I need YOUR help particularly with playtesting upcoming tables features

## ü§ñ Building it yourself

Instructions coming soon (once I have a build for each platform)

You will need:
- Un4seen BASS libraries for your platform
- To make sure you recursively clone the Prelude submodule

MacOS/Linux build should work in theory, so with enough requests I can properly start doing cross-platform support/releases
