## ðŸ‘Œ How to play:

Go [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude/releases) for pre-built versions (works out of box on Windows)

**MAKE SURE [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1/runtime) is installed!** (Or it won't open)

## ðŸ¤– Building it yourself

Instructions coming soon (once I have a build for each platform)

You will need:
- Un4seen BASS libraries for your platform
- To make sure you recursively clone the Prelude submodule

MacOS/Linux build should work in theory, so with enough requests I can properly start doing cross-platform support/releases
