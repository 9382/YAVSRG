### Yet Another Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game

YAVSRG (Yet Another Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game) is a rhythm game wrote in C# ~~by a sarcastic prick~~ designed for all keymodes with the intent of combining the best features from other rhythm games to create a space that can be used equally casually and competitively.

### So, why make my own rhythm game?

Well, the truth is, osu sucks competitively; etterna sucks casually.

I plan to have the best of both worlds with regards to charting features. Mines will be retained from stepmania and the functionality of LNs and SVs will be retained from osu, this will allow for a significantly more diverse charting lineup + all files will eventually be converted to the .YAV format, where files can have both mines and svs simultaneously.

YAV will be an extremely versatile client, supporting all styles of play with modifiers for competitive play (rates, screen covers) and for casual play (chord cohesion etc.) YAV will also support any amount of keymodes and support loading of the .osu and .sm filetypes for this. Some features YAV will have that other rhythm games do not have include note colors based on chords and similar reading modifiers.

YAV also contains a custom difficulty calculator, in which charts are rated based on their approximate dan in two categories. Physical and Technical. Physical is simply how physically strenuous the chart is, while technical is how difficult the chart is from a technical perspective (polyrhythms, difficult to read patterns, misleading patterning etc.) YAV also uses it's own scoring algorithms, derived as a means of balancing both osu and wife scoring, players are punished more for being inaccurate than missing.

Eventually I am planning for there to be charting software incorporated into YAV which will support mines, lns and sv usage like both charting softwares combined, but this is something distant from current development.
