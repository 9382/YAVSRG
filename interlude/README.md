# **YAVSRG: Interlude**
### Yet Another Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game

Read about what this is [on the fancy Github page](https://percyqaz.github.io/YAVSRG)

### Building it yourself

Instructions coming soon (once I have a build for each platform)

You will need:
- Un4seen bass libraries for your platform
- Some fonts and other stuff that aren't in the repo

MacOS build is held off by needing to update the render engine to GL core 3.1 or above (it otherwise builds, just black screen)

Linux build is held off by lack of testing

Go [here](https://github.com/percyqaz/YAVSRG/releases) for pre-built versions (works out of box on Windows)
You also need [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1/runtime) installed

### Licenses and stuff

Interlude is licensed under the GPLv3 License.
The audio library used is [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) and requires a license for commercial use (just so you know).
