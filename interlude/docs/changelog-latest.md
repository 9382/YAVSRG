Various small features requested by you

PLEASE NOTE I have made a technical change to how personal bests are stored (will allow more cool features)  
To recalculate your PBs on level select, go to Options > Library > Recalculate scores and let it run in the background for a few minutes

# New stuff
- More information is shown when you hover on the score screen graph
- Options to draw standard deviation/mean as the score graph line instead of combo
- Options to filter the score graph dots by columns
- Improved UI for selecting fullscreen resolutions and refresh rates
- Mod select now shows what effect your selection has on score ranking/saving
- Right-click drag scrolling on level select has been changed to be more like it used to
- New level select sorts: By length and by date added
- Scores using the Shuffle and Random mods are now saved
- The pacemaker will compare you to your live replay from your personal best rather than just using the final accuracy as a target

# Bugs fixed
- Fixed preset buttons having too small of a clickable area
- Fixed note colors sometimes not updating correctly when changing presets
- Fixed error in standard deviation and mean calculations on score screen
