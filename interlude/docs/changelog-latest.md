A few fixes and improvements

# New features
- The 'Graph Settings' button does something after all this time
  You can now set a mode for a line graph to render, by default it shows your combo progression over time
- Game now tracks some stats like number of notes hit and your total playtime
  This will become a screen you can look at eventually, for now it is hidden away in stats.json (and controls the session time display on the score screen)
  
# Bug fixes
- Options menu buttons will not select themselves just because the mouse is over them, only when you move the mouse yourself
- Scrolling in containers with the arrow keys is no longer janky
- Scrolling in containers with the mouse wheel is no longer janky

I've also been improving the secret pattern analyser and some of its reports will be showing in level select soon
You can currently see the output by enabling Printerlude and typing `patterns` in the console
