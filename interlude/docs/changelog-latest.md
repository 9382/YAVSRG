Some requested features to make the engine feel a little more familiar (mostly for 4k players)
I won't go into too much detail because Discord has a 2000 character limit

# 'Vanishing notes' setting
Go to Debug > Check this setting to make notes render like they do in Stepmania/similar engines
Hit notes will vanish and unhit notes will scroll past the receptors until they are hit or count as missed

4k players who play other games and have their reading directly tied to this visual cue, this may make you feel more at home
This is not enabled by default, you need to enable it!

# 'Automatic sync' setting
Go to Debug > Check this setting to enable automatic sync
Local offset will be adjusted whenever you finish/restart a chart
This means you can retry the intro of a chart 1 or 2 times to sync it
For manual syncing tools, visit Practice mode

# 'Prioritise low judges' setting
Gameplay > HUD > Judgement Meter
When this setting is OFF (default, and this is new behaviour), the judgement meter always shows the most recent judge
When this setting is ON, the judgement meter shows the worst judgement in the last 500ms (or however long the fade time is set)

You may find this less confusing and more familiar, even though it is objectively less useful IMO

# Other fixes
- You can make the bars thinner on hit meter, the minimum has changed from 5 pixels to 1 pixel
