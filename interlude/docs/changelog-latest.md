UI and UX improvement update!

## Bug fixes:
- Fixed issue with multiplayer chat not scrolling properly
- Fixed rare crash when previewing certain charts

## UI changes and improvements:
- Tooltips now look fancier (and I've updated them with better information)
- Cursor turns white if tooltip information is available
- Options menu has been redesigned a little (still more to do)
	- Gameplay binds are now under Gameplay
	- Hotkey binds are now under System
	- Keybinds menu has been removed
- Lots of UI changes, mainly color scheme stuff (let me know what you think)
	- Notifications
	- Mod select
	- Toolbar buttons
- Most of the UI changes are geared at making it easy for players to naturally discover/stumble upon the features they need
	
## Feature re-releases
The "Random chart" and "Comments" features have existed for a little while, but noone knows they exist
This is my fault for not making it easy to discover the features, so now there are visible buttons on the level select screen
Consider them re-released

Comments = You can write arbitrary notes on your charts and search through them
Random chart = Not actually random, it uses the first draft of a suggestions algorithm to recommend you a similar chart. Try it out! I need feedback

I won't say more than that as hopefully the new UI stuff ingame lets you find out how these work fully on your own, we'll see

## New stuff
- You can preview charts while in a lobby
- You can add charts to collections while in a lobby
