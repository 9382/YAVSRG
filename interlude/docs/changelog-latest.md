Bug fix update, Yippee!

- Bug fix: A crash when you don't have any favourite rulesets
- Bug fix: Ruleset picker (the big one, not the quick switcher) looks better and is less glitchy
- Bug fix: Technical rating is shown and is confusing. It is no longer shown
- Bug fix: Clicking on sorting/grouping buttons was treated as also clicking on the chart below the button
- Minor feature: Press Shift+D to open the ruleset picker (the big one not the switcher) on level select and score screen
