Some new online features!

# Compare against your friends
In the Stats screen, under tables, you can now pick a friend to compare your table scores with.  
Add friends to your list via the Discord bot (UI to do this ingame coming soon)

# Claim a rank on table leaderboards
If you set a new table score you will get a position on the table's leaderboard, also accessible from the Stats screen.  
Hopefully this will encourage some of you to outfarm me to help find what needs adjusting
