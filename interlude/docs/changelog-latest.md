Slightly delayed feature update  
I also redesigned the site a little, go check it out :)

# Smart frame cap overhaul
It should now run a lot smoother on more hardware, but needs some field testing  

If the game now runs like absolute butter for you please let me know and applaud my genius in the Discord  
If the game now runs worse for you please immediately complain in the Discord and I can take a look  

# Noteskin and HUD features
- Early/late meter now supports noteskin textures the same way the judgement meter does

# Other features
- More informational toasts/notifications for various things such as when an osu! skin.ini fails to parse
- osu! skin converter now converts judgement textures over to noteskins
- New gameplay modifier: More notes -- This is experimental and subject to change, therefore you cannot save scores with it on
- Discord rich presence activity now has an icon

# Bug fixes
- Fixed background images being smeared horizontally if the game initialised while minimised in fullscreen
- Fixed LN% and note counts not updating when changing selected mods
- Fixed a crash in the HUD editor nobody knew about
