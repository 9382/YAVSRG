Found a bug in osu! conversions, recently introduced by accident, that produces bugged LNs
If you converted your osu! songs folder in the last couple of weeks I would delete the imported charts and reconvert them
If you converted your osu! songs folder a long time ago you shouldn't see any issues and the bug is now fixed

# Other fixes
- You should now be able to download table charts right after installing a new table
- Sorting modes like 'Grade achieved' no longer show charts multiple times if you have duplicates in different folders
