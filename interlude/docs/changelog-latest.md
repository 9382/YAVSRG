Hope you're having a nice summer, I know I have been
Here's some new stuff I added in between weekend excursions

# New cache system
- Implemented a new organisation system for the cache and Songs folder
  YOUR CACHE WILL BE BROKEN WHEN YOU UPDATE, AND A RECACHE WILL BE NEEDED
  A RECACHE WILL MIGRATE YOUR EXISTING CHARTS TO THE NEW FOLDER STRUCTURE
  THE RECACHE WILL RUN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU UPDATE AND OPEN THE GAME
  If that fails, you can still rerun it from Options > Debug > Rebuild cache
- New cache system will simplify many things in the future, like multiplayer downloads
  
# New features
- Thanks to the new cache, you can now group by Date added
  This is the time when the chart was downloaded/converted/imported to Interlude

# Bug fixes
- Judgement meter, hit meter, early/late meter should now fade at the correct speed even on rates
- Fixed some Stepmania files converting without audio, amongst a couple of other bugs with chart conversions
- Fixed audio bug when seeking to start of song in practice mode

# Other improvements
- Applying settings presets has a confirmation page to fool-proof accidentally messing yourself up
- ^ The buttons are also further apart for the same reason
- Practice mode starts at beginning of song, not where it was playing when you enter the screen
- Converted Stepmania files get difficulty names like "4K Challenge 21" instead of "Dance_Single 21"
- Online signup page mentions the 18+ age requirement of accounts
- Some new menu splashes
