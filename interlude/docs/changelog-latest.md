Bug fix update

# Bugs fixed
- Fixed dots on score graph being slightly vertically off
- 'Continue' button shows notification when it failed to find anything, instead of doing nothing
- Fix wife lamp colors and J9 scoring curve (again)
- Fix KPS meter showing 0.5x the right number

# Changes
- Endless mode now suggests things on rates (so that on that rate, it's similar to what you just played)
- Endless mode should now suggest better stuff
- Moved preview/mods/rulesets buttons on level select back where they were

# New stuff
- `pattern=...` in level select can now pick out particular patterns e.g `pattern=quadstream`

This update will need to recalculate patterns for all installed charts. This is automatically done when you update
