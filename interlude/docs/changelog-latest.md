0.7.18.6
====

This update has nothing new, it's just me testing that the release pipeline still works after the ImageSharp CVE caused build warnings to appear

I will have to upgrade ImageSharp to a patched version at some point but for now feel free to execute as much arbitrary code on your own machine as you like

This update also includes updating GLFW 3.3.7 -> 3.3.8 which looks like it contains fixes for the segfaults on M1/M2
Perhaps this will mean I can start doing official releases for macOS?
