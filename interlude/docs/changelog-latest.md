# Multi-select and bulk actions

In level select, you can now select multiple charts/groups by holding shift + clicking  

After doing so, there is a bulk actions button that lets you do stuff like:  

- Deleting multiple charts at once
- Exporting multiple charts to .osz (use with caution when exporting a lot)
- Adding a batch of charts to a collection/likes

# Other new stuff
- Skip button has been improved to take you closer to the first note
- Transition into gameplay now fades the audio
- Info card at the start of gameplay can be dismissed by pressing the skip key
- You can export as .osz from the score screen chart actions

# Bug fixes
- Fixed a chart database issue that broke @Lifly's game. **If you also had this issue, you need to download this update manually and swap your Interlude.exe for the new one**.
- Fixed a pixel seam in screen transitions
