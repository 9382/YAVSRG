Patch update to resolve some reported bugs with chart conversions
Also this is me double checking that my auto-update rollout system is fixed after what happened earlier today

# Bug fixes
- Fixed certain badly formatted .sm files from converting as corrupt .yav files (and for Newson, a recache will clean out any of your existing broken files)
- Fixed flickering visual issues when rendering Quaver files with negative SV
- Fixed InitialScrollVelocity being ignored when converting Quaver files

Thanks again to people quick to the draw on playtesting the Quaver conversion, let me know if there are other issues
