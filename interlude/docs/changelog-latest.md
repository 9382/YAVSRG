Fixes some issues and cut corners in pattern analysis based on this morning's feedback

# Pattern analysis changes
- Fixed a bug causing the game to load pattern data slower than it should
- More charts categorised as "Jack" now correct get categorised as "Chordjack"
- Fixed a bug where the score screen just shows patterns for your current chart + rate, not for the score
- Added a tip about searching for patterns on the search box tooltip
