0.7.20.1

Patch update as an excuse for me to test out my new CI tools and make sure I didn't break anything

# Bug fixes
- Swapped to Mino for osu! beatmap downloads as chimu.moe is down
- Fixed osu! skin import list not scrolling when you have many

# Improvements
In the 'Textures' tab of the noteskin editor, you can now toggle between textures stored as a grid or as loose files  
This is to suit your preference depending on how you like to edit/distribute images  

In future I plan on enforcing grid textures for zipped .isks as they load faster and it's easier to copy paste a texture as a single grid from them
