Collections and quality-of-life update

## Collections

- Collections have been rewritten. As previously mentioned if anyone has collections they want to keep let me know in the discord.
  
- There are two kinds of collection: Folders and Playlists
  Folders are groups of charts like osu! 'collections'
  Playlists are ordered lists of charts including the gameplay modifiers and a specific rate for the chart
  
- Added library views: All, Collections and Table
  These are what gets shown on level select.
  
  'Table' view is a placeholder for more fleshed out table features
  'Collections' view lists all collections
  'All' is just the normal list of every chart you have

- You can quick-add and quick-remove charts from a 'selected' collection (more info is provided by the relevant menus)
  This is a lot quicker and more convenient than going through the right-click menus.

- Collections can be assigned various icons, and these are shown in level select. The display icons are a bit smaller and look better when you also have a comment on the chart.

## QOL

- Hotkeys can now be individually reset in the keybinds menu
- Hotkeys can now be reset all at once in the keybinds menu
  **I would recommend doing this as some bindings have been changed and will not automatically change when you update**

- Scoreboard looks a little different :)
  Also you can now focus it by pressing Z (by default)
  This lets you navigate it with the keyboard/press enter to view the screen for a score
  
- You can press . (by default) to open the context menu for charts (or for scores with the above scoreboard navigation feature)
  Equivalent to right-clicking.

- Added and updated a BUNCH of hotkeys around level select for ease of navigation with keyboard-only if that pleases you

- The hotkey for many level select buttons are shown when displaying the tooltip info for that button. The key to show these is still ? (by default)

- Fixed several bugs:
  - Etterna pack downloads should be up again (caused by expired certificate)
  - Scoreboard refreshes when selecting mods with "Current mods" filter active
  - Some others
  
- Various locale consistency fixes
