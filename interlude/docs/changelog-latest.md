*Skinning update*

Noteskins and HUD layouts have become separate things, and a Skin is a new container folder that can hold one or both of these things
An .isk file now represets a Skin (so it can contain a noteskin, hud layout or both)

You don't need to do anything, your existing noteskins should be turned automatically into new Skin folders

# New features
- You can now select which HUD and which Noteskin to use independently of each other
- Timelines and score graphs now display timestamps
- Options menu previews now display HUD elements, explosions and column lighting
- You can set negative column spacings and hold trim values ingame instead of manually editing noteskin files

# Many UI improvements
- Hold backspace to delete text
- You can re-download Etterna packs that are already installed
- The 'Import' button now opens a menu instead of a dropdown
- Presets UI has been updated and improved
- A bunch of other really tiny but nice changes
