# New stuff
- Ingame wiki has had a major makeover
- Ingame wiki now uses the new site wiki, which has been updated a little
- The 'WIP' texture editor pages when editing noteskins have been fleshed out, allowing you to rotate, flip, add and remove individual textures
- The button to update the game has been improved, and can restart the game on successful update
- Fixed bug in screenshots after the file size fix of 0.7.9.2

Also check the site out, I've updated it to look a bit fancier
