Multiplayer technical leaps

I'm testing out the new account registration system 
You can now link an account to your Discord account and that account is how you log into Interlude

**Please note: ** Accounts are currently temporary and get wiped whenever the server restarts
No data is held against them other than your Discord ID so try and break it/find bugs before I start storing data for real

You have a couple weeks cause I'm going on holiday

## Features
- All online features (multiplayer lobbies) use end-to-end encryption
- Placeholder login where you 'claim' a name replaced with log in via discord

## Other fixes/improvements
- The Interlude.exe icon might be back, I'm not really sure until it goes through the build pipeline
- I've rewritten some major parts of Prelude, hence some time between releases to see if I spot any bugs
  You may see some improvements in background image detection for .sm files and various metadata conversion fixes
- Fixed a rare crash when interacting with osu! song search
- osu! downloads use a different mirror (perhaps multiple mirror options coming soon)
- Some new menu splash messages
