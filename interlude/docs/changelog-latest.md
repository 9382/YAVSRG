0.6.10.2
====

Here's some more multiplayer features!

### Features
- When round ends, you can now see lamp and grade scored by you and other players
- Pressing "Start round" now has a 5 second countdown so it's less abrupt
- Added lobby setting: Host rotation (can be turned on/off)
  Automatically passes host to the next player whenever a round successfully completes
- Added lobby setting: Automatic countdown (can be turned on/off)
  The round countdown automatically begins if everyone is ready
  If someone is no longer ready, it automatically cancels
  
### Fixes
- Occasional issues with automatic login on game start
  
Host rotation is not reliable with big groups/strangers as someone can go AFK and never pick a song
Instead of adding more features to deal with this, there will later be a "Song queue" feature that anyone can add to so that host rotation doesn't need to exist
