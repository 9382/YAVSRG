0.7.13.2

# New features
- Changed how noteskin textures are rendered/sampled to reduce jagged edges on certain monitors
  It is on by default for your noteskins, but if you use bars/don't like this, it can be turned off for a crisper look
- You can now set custom column spacings, per column, per keymode via Options > Noteskins > Playfield

# Improvements
- Various codebase improvements
- Some performance improvements on information dense screens, particularly on level select (I now get ~680fps up from ~450)
- Density timeline on previews, practice mode and replays has been improved with some help from @9382
- Table suggestions screen has had some small improvements but still a WIP

# Bug fixes
- Fixed a bug when seeking to negative audio timestamps
- Fixed a bug where noteskin previews would sometimes show the top pixels of the preview at the bottom
