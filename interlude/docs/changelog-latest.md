0.7.6
====

Many improvements and bug fixes in different places

# Bug fixes:
- Some broken background images/audio files in Crescent have been fixed
- Fixed the game logo disappearing if you click "Play" or any other screen-changing button too fast
- Fixed a bug in netcode when exiting the game
- Fixed some things not saving properly if you click the X on the black box to close the game

# Improvements
- Various minor things about the UI have been improved (icons, text wording, etc)

# New features:
- Personal best tracking has been rewritten to store ALL of your "best" info, rather than just your best across all rates, and your highest rate
- Added 'Patterns' grouping mode to level select - It's quite basic at the moment but does somewhat accurately categorise your charts
- Added 'Breakdown' tab when looking at table stats, it shows what scores contribute to your table rating

osu! and Etterna rulesets have been modified to hopefully make them more accurate to those games

Go to Imports > Rulesets to install the updates and see what you think

Your personal bests data will be wiped by the update, use the `fix_personal_bests` console command to recalculate them from your scores (takes about 30 seconds)
