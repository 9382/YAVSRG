Thank you all for the support as Interlude launches its open beta!
Here's some new stuff based on feedback I got this week

# New features
- Ingame osu!mania beatmap downloads are back and improved, thanks to NeriNyan's API
- Under system settings you can pick a video mode for your monitor

# Bug fixes
- Fixed a crash related to viewing online leaderboards
- Fixed an error when importing stepmania files with no notes in them
- Fixed a visual bug in screen transitions, thanks to @9382
- Fixed some audio bugs when switching to another chart using the same audio file, thanks to @9382
- Fixed level select wheel over-scrolling if you queue up several actions at once, thanks to @9382
- Fixed a minor bug in online score saving
- Fixed a minor visual bug in level select

I'm also part way through massively cleaning up and refactoring code YAVSRG-wide so there will be some actual consistency in the code style, and contributing will be easier
