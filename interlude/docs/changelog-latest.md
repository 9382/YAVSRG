Noteskins update!

# New stuff
- Hit Ctrl+E to quick-open the noteskin editing menu
- Noteskin editing menu has had a major rework, including:
	- Editing playfield screen position, column spacing, etc
	- Editing animation speeds and settings
	- Editing note rotation values per column
	- Better tooltip explanations and previewing overall
- Score screen mean/SD only includes taps, not releases. Tooltip information shows the values for releases
- osu! Skin conversion now has some UI instead of just running (and failing) silently - More to come
- Some other skinning stuff in the works

# Fixes and improvements
- Fixed an unreported bug where hold note tails don't rotate with UseHoldTailTexture turned off
- Text entries in menus have a box around them so you can see them even when empty
- Various minor UI improvements
