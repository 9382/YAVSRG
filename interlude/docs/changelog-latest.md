# Import your osu! scores
If you have linked and imported your osu! songs library via the Import menu, there is now an option to import your scores too!  
Click 'Manage' and you will see a button for it.  
As with all new features, if you notice any bugs or errors please report them to me via Discord or GitHub.

# Other improvements
- When selecting noteskins, they now have an icon preview
- New HUD features: Rate meter and BPM meter (both requested by Lifly)
- Fixed visual bug in preview as it scrolls into view on options menus
- osu! rulesets have more accurate LN simulation thanks to some experiments while adding score importing

More noteskin UI improvements coming soon, but I ran out of time tonight and wanted to release what I had
