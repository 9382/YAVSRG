0.7.19.5
====

I have not heard complaints about the new smart frame cap so that is good  
Here are some more features :)

# New gameplay features
- 'Shuffle' and 'Randomise' modifiers, check them out in the mods menu for more info
- Option under pacemaker settings to only save scores that are a new record of some form

# Bug fixes
- Fixed pressing enter sometimes not playing the chart for some reason (I know the exact reason)
- Fixed a bug causing osu! skin converter to use different textures to what osu! stable does
- Fixed mod meter showing the wrong mods when watching replays

# Other improvements
- Text appears in top right reminding users of Ctrl-O to change local offset
- Slight improvements to ingame noteskin texture editor
