## What's a table?

A table = a ton of charts hand-sorted into levels/folders.  
You work through each folder, setting a certain standard of score, and each folder is a good-sized step to slowly push your skills and improve.

Interlude is getting tables because:
- It gives the game the closest thing to "official" content - There will be clear goals to achieve rather than just picking stuff to play every session
- It lets me collect some sweet sweet analytics data for difficulty calculation algorithms
- It provides useful progression advice to players while the aforementioned difficulty calculation algorithms are made

## Table stuff

Following on from 0.6.7's collections update, the "Table" library mode and buttons now do more stuff

- Clicking 'Manage Tables' displays a menu where you can select any installed tables if you have any (Check discord for initial release of a test table to try this out)

- Added some hidden stuff for creating and editing your own table. You can toggle it on via Printerlude if you're curious

- I'm in the process of setting up:
	- Some nice tooling for contributing to tables and publishing changelogs when they get updated
	- Some infrastructure for installing tables into your Interlude client from the 'Manage Tables' menu
