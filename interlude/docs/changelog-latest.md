Some online features just for you

# New features
- If you are logged in, scores you set are automatically submitted to the server and go on your profile
- Some limited charts now have leaderboards (again requires a logged-in account)
- You can set your profile color via the discord bot, this shows up in multiplayer chat

More leaderboards for table charts will roll out as long as no problems come up
