# Spectating in multiplayer
- You can now ready up as a spectator rather than a player to watch other people play
- You can start spectating mid round, either if you quit out as a player or if you join the lobby midway through a round
- While it should be stable it is a bit janky (the audio pauses and resumes while spectating buffers sometimes)

# The Interlude.exe icon is back
Finally...

# Press Q to see patterns
- I moved the pattern analyser from a tooltip to text that replaces the scoreboard
- Press Q to toggle this; Better UI and better pattern data coming soon
