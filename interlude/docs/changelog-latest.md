Hey I have some new stuff for You

# New features and UI improvements
- Playlists now display how long they last if played back to back
- Improvements to practice mode so it feels less cluttered
- You can now take screenshots even in menus and on the chart preview
- Some upgrades to pattern analysis in progress, this update gets you a sneak peek at the halfway point
- Discord Rich Prescence
- Clicking on a text entry will keep it focused until you click something else

# Bug fixes
- Fixed bug in how timestamps are saved/converted from UTC
- Fixed ingame progress timer showing -1:-1 as a song ends
- Fixed the LN rendering glitch when seeking to an earlier point in a song in previews and practice mode
- Possibly fixed being "Not logged in" even though the logs say you logged in fine

More stuff coming soon but I am busy this weekend and moving house the next so we'll see
