More UX improvements
Special thanks to Eliminate for playtesting the game while sat next to me, I got a TON of useful info out of that

# New features
- You can now choose your windowed resolution properly ingame via the System settings
- While watching a replay, can now turn on Input Overlay to see the raw inputs
- Can now change song rate while previewing a chart

## Improvements
- The songs folder now has a "HOW_TO_ADD_SONGS.txt" to help confused users
- Pressing ESC now closes the comment UI/open dropdowns instead of leaving the level select screen
- Extracted themes/noteskins now have a real folder name instead of nonsense
- Improved performance of level select screen when other menus are overlaid on it (preview should lag less when 10000 charts are visible)
- Logo now has a "breathing" effect

## Fixes
- Fixed checkbox options having their icons the wrong way round
- Fixed chart preview not including some leadin time before the first note
- Fixed audio position skipping around when changing rates (now it should be seamless)
- Fixed mean/standard deviation on score screen treating misses as +180ms
- Fixed linking to another game's song library not instantly importing it
- Fixed some missing hotkeys from tooltips
- Fixed dropdowns turning blank when the window is resized
