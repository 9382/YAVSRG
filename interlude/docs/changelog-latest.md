# New features
- The options menu has been reorganised a little bit
  Let me know what you think, hopefully you have to dig through fewer nested menus to find what you need now
- 'Advanced' settings is the home of opt-in experimental features
- Notification for taking a screenshot has a button to open the screenshots folder (requested by Wagg)
- New setting for hit meter to turn off the scaling factor for LN releases (requested by Lifly)
- You can change your ruleset while in multiplayer lobbies

- Pattern analyzer: It's still a work-in-progress, but I've simplified its output to be presentable to users
  Press the tooltip hotkey (/ by default) while hovering over the difficulty rating to see this info
  With your feedback, it will become even more useful
  
# Improvements
- Mod select menu looks a little less poo
- Noteskin select menu is different, let me know what you think (I have more changes planned but am under time constraints)
- The 'chart suggestions' feature is now an experimental feature you opt into in the 'Advanced' options menu
  When you press the random key, it now just gives you an actually random chart by default

# Bug fixes
- Arrow key navigation in some menus is the most glitchless it's ever been
- Fixed several crashes in the import screen
- Fixed some crashes in the score screen graph
- Fixed a crash in multiplayer if you quit out instantly after the round begins
- Fixed a bug where the host could select mods just for them in multiplayer
