0.6.10
====

First release of multiplayer!

In this version of the client there is now a secret way to
- Connect to an online server
- Start or join a multiplayer lobby
- Play songs together in it

This is heavily under development so expect some bugs and imperfect UI design

You can claim a username when you connect to the server but *THIS IS NOT AN ACCOUNT* and when you disconnect, the name becomes free to claim again.
Accounts are coming later.

The only data stored about you is:
- The username you choose when you connect
- State such as what lobby you are in
- The replay for the score you are currently setting in a lobby
This data is deleted when you disconnect from the server/exit the game.
