Bug fix update, enjoy
I did a load of refactoring too

# Bug fixes
- Fixed a crash when a chart fails to load while no chart was currently loaded
- Fixed not being able to retry in practice mode while playing
- Fixed not being able to unpause replays when at the start of the song
- Fixed visual issue with hit overlay on replays
- Fixed being able to interact with/click on UI elements that are visually under notifications
- Fixed some issues with dropdowns closing when hovering over another UI element behind it
- Fixed accuracy 'glint' effect on score screen only playing if you went up a grade
- Fixed game constantly reconnecting to server if out of date

# Improvements
- UI for setting up a mount of your osu!/Etterna/StepMania library is much better
- Made local scores a bit more compact to make room for the future
- Inverse mod has modes with different gap sizes
- Inverse mod can be used with NoLN to produce FLN charts
- Logo waveform looks better
