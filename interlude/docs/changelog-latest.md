THE PATTERN ANALYSIS UPDATE  
Well, at least a good proof of concept

Upon updating your game will take a minute to cache all the patterns in every chart you have, for speedy searching!  

# New features:
- Random chart suggestions is much better at picking out similar charts for you, I recommend trying it out
- You can filter for patterns in the search box (try `pattern=jumpstream`)

# Bug fixes:
- Rolls in 4k charts should be detected as "streams" much less often
- Random chart suggestions will no longer suggest things it's already suggested before

# Improvements:
- Chart info mode when pressing Q looks more consistent with the scoreboard

These features need feedback on how they should work best, so let me know what patterns you'd like to be able to search for,
 and, if you'd like a grouping mode that groups charts by pattern, let me know what categories you'd like
