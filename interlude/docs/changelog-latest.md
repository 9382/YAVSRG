0.6.4
====

New features around user settings!

- Under Themes > Edit Theme > Gameplay Config you can now edit the position and other settings about gameplay widgets
  - Includes accuracy meter, combo meter, hit meter and more
  - Includes tooltips explaining what things do
- Added a color picker for screen covers, allowing you to change the color from ingame
- Fixed several bugs with gameplay widgets that were discovered while putting these settings in

You can now do more theme stuff in-game (and see its effects quicker) instead of making manual edits in your theme folder
