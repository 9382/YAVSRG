0.7.2
====

I've updated some internals of the game - In particular "hashes", unique ids that can be calculated for each chart, have been changed  
This update will migrate your scores, songs, collections, etc to the new hashing system

The server will mark your client as out of date until you have updated

As a bonus any bugged osu! files you have scores on will be repaired and you will keep your scores :)

Other bug fixes
- Score timestamps no longer display wrong when loaded from disk vs set while the game is open
- Pack imports may be significantly faster for people with slow drives
- Table level select mode should load/search significantly faster
