UI improvement update

# Bug fixes:
- Your leaderboard score now gets replaced if you upload a better score
- Can view leaderboards even without the intended ruleset selected

# Improvements:
- Score screen looks a little bit better :)

# New features:
- Added a 'Stats' screen, displaying some stats that have been tracked since 0.6.21
- Stats screen shows breakdown of your table grades if available (still under construction)

More stats stuff will come, hopefully it provides a motive for you to farm the table and therefore report balance issues

Also, nearly every chart in Crescent now has a leaderboard available
