# More engine improvements
- Added compensation for 1 frame of visual delay on 'Smart' cap mode
- You can override the intended framerate of 'Smart' cap by editing config.json
- On 'Smart' cap, VSync will disable itself if the game detects it is not maintaining the intended framerate
- When VSync is off, a CPU timing strategy will be used instead, I STRONGLY recommend leaving VSync settings as default if they work for you
