As usual thank you players new and old for trying the game and giving feedback :)

# Noteskin and HUD features
- Noteskins now support custom textures for judgement indicators! Skinners rejoice - Template skins, documentation, etc coming soon
- Judgement meter has an improved animation, which can be turned off if you want to use a texture-only animation
- HUD editor is part of the noteskin editor + improved navigation to it
- Hold shift + use arrow keys to make 1-pixel adjustments in the HUD editor

# UI improvements
- Audio rates can be changed with a slider from the mods menu, to help more people find it
- Ruleset switcher now correctly scrolls instead of clipping offscreen when you have lots installed
- Score screen now shows who made the chart
- Score screen slightly adjusted to look better
- All menus have been overall re-scaled and adjusted to look more consistent

# Bug fixes
- Fixed a crash when viewing the tooltip on the ruleset picker
- Fixed several issues with Smart frame cap on multi-monitor setups
- Fixed parts of main menu disappearing if you tab out in fullscreen while it loads
- Fixed hotkey for reloading themes/noteskins not reloading certain config about textures

Lots of UI code was changed for this update, I might have missed something  
If you spot anything that looks wrong please report it
