0.7.24.5
====

I'm away most of this weekend so have this small update

# New stuff
- New VERY EXPERIMENTAL secret tool to import Etterna noteskins, drag and drop a noteskin folder onto the game to try it
- Mode on score graph to show accuracy as a line graph
- Option to change line graph color to match grade instead of lamp
- New 'Quick menu' where common actions will be placed, this replaces the home tab in Options
- Hold CTRL + SHIFT + (plus or minus) to change rates by +-25%

# Bug fixes
- Fixed lots of rate-modded beatmaps where the offset has also been edited getting past the import filter
