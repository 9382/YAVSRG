Multiplayer bug fix update

- You can now see invites to lobbies on the lobby list screen
  (notifications/alerts when you aren't on this screen are yet to come)
- Fixed like a good few dozen crash bugs
- Some small UI improvements while in the lobby screen (mostly indicators for missing a chart)
- Multiplayer results printed to the chat look a bit better
- Added a temporary display of live scores while you're playing
  This is enabled if Pacemaker is enabled in your theme (and uses its placement data)
