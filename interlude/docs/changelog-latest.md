Yet Another Quality Of Life Update

- New feature: Inverse mod (coming soon: customising of the gap size)
- Bug fix: NoSV would always count as being applied on osu! converts (unranking your score)
- New feature: There is a clickable back button on options menus (alternative to pressing escape)
- New feature: You can export your noteskins as .isk files via the noteskins menu
- Bug fix: Sort by Technical rating is gone
- Improvement: The mod menu/pacemaker UI has been split
  And so it shall stay for the time being, so I've removed the WIP markers
