0.7.18.2
====

I've rewritten some parts of how the mouse interacts with UI elements based on recent feedback
If you notice any unusual behaviour or bugs as a result please let me know

# Improvements
- All buttons/hoverables should no longer feel "sticky" when hovered with the mouse - moving the mouse away will "unhover" them
- All buttons/hoverables will still be sticky-highlighted when hovered using keyboard controls, working as before
- Went and tweaked/improved several tiny details of UI to work better
- Multiplayer chat should now correctly scroll to show the latest message
- You can now hold escape to exit out of nested menu pages so you don't have to spam the button
- Hold note combo bug in osu!mania ruleset reported by CommandoBlack should now be fixed
- Background images signficantly bigger than the game window are downscaled for performance

Some improvements to noteskin explosion animations are planned for next release
