## Improvements
- Gameplay setting presets now have hotkeys for switching them quickly (for you multi-keymode mains who use different settings for each)
- Record improvement indicators on score screen now display how much you improved your record by

## Features
- The fabled Judgement Meter HUD item has made a return after many years being commented out
  Currently it displays all judgements (there is no way to turn off Marvellous/300g from being displayed)
  Hiding the "perfect" judgements will be added when the early/late meter is added which will also be soon
