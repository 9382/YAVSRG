Bug fix update for my beloved play testers

- Bug fix: Releasing a long note on osu! ruleset will now correctly break your combo
- Bug fix: Combo breaks other than from missing now correctly affect lamp on osu ruleset
- Bug fix: Dropped hold notes no longer only grey out when the tail is visible on the screen
- Some other adjustments to error logging and stuff

I normally make a rule not to mention things that are work in progress in these changelogs
So I'm not going to, but if you're in the discord you may know what is underway :)
