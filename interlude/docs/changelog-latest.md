## Stuff that's new

- This changelog is automatically posted to Discord :)
- Fixed some crash bugs
- Renamed Screencover to Lane Cover (this is what it's more commonly known as)
- Pacemaker stuff as explained below

### **Pacemaker features**

- Added a positionable pacemaker gameplay component (access via Themes > Edit Theme > Gameplay Config)
- You can now set and use per-ruleset pacemakers (e.g. If you are on Wife3 you can set a pacemaker for 93.5%)
- Pacemakers can either be an accuracy target or a lamp target
- When enabled, your pace compared to accuracy targets is shown with a flag (a bit like the crown in osu! lobbies)
- Lamp targets as shown as the amount of "lives" you have
  Getting the wrong judgement loses a life
  When you run out of lives, you missed out on the lamp!
- Special feature: Challenging scores!
  To challenge a score, right click it in the scoreboard and select "Challenge"
  This will make it a pacemaker as you play, and indicate if you are ahead or behind the existing score's pace
  Being ahead/behind is updated based on the accuracy you had at that point in the chart (not final accuracy of that score)
  
To access pacemaker settings you can either:
- Configure them as before under Options > Gameplay > Pacemaker
- Configure them under the Mods menu in level select

The pacemaker must be turned on by you when you want to use it (it is not always on)
This is to make it something you declare to yourself you're going to do right before playing (a bit like using Sudden Death in osu!)
I'm interested in what effect this has:
- Maybe it will make you play better and focus properly
- Maybe it will be used to signify the end of warming up
- Maybe it will never get used because everyone will forget to turn it on
