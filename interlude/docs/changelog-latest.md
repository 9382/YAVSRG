0.6.5.2
====

- Removed "Goals" collection type, this is in advance of a new goals system in the future :)
  This will break your collections.json if you have a Goals collection (I'm certain nobody is)
  
  There are other collections changes coming up which may break collections
  When the time comes, if anyone really does have collections they want to preserve give me a shout in the discord
  
- You can now hold right-click to fast scroll on scrolling containers.
  This is to help with navigating Imports > Etterna packs and Options > Keybinds > Hotkeys
