Major rulesets update!

Rulesets have been rewritten and **your old rulesets will no longer load**.  
In exchange, the ruleset editor is much more powerful so you'll be able to recreate your ruleset in about 10 minutes

# New ruleset features
- Built in osu!mania rulesets are now extremely accurate to the stable client, rice notes on nomod in particular are 100% exact to what osu! would give you
- New option for rulesets to display accuracy to 3 or 4 decimal places instead of 2
- New option for rulesets to award a penalty judgement when you ghost tap
- Ruleset editor now allows you to add/remove judgements, customise timing windows and more without editing the .ruleset directly
- Ability to clone a ruleset

The rewrite has had some other knock-on improvements to other connected features

# Other new features
- Score graph data is now more granular and hover info is more accurate to your mouse position
- Songs you click through on level select are added to history, shift + R takes you back
- Improvements to pattern analysis and chart categorisation
- New 'annotations' overlay when viewing a replay, showing exact ms deviations of hits, ghost taps and more
- Replay mode has an option to keep the same perceived scroll speed when changing playback speed

# Bug fixes
- Fixed dozens of small issues where times would not scale on rates across various HUD elements and animations
- Fixed a bug causing performance rating to scale incorrectly on rates
- Fixed exporting charts to osu! not normalising BPMs correctly
- Playlists in level select now show PB info for the rate set by the playlist
