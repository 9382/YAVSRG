More important bug fixes, thanks again to playtesters of the new features

# Bugs fixed
- Fixed a crash when giving up halfway through a song
- Fixed some Quaver SV charts not rendering the same as Quaver would (but there are still a couple of unusual cases to look into)

# New features
- New moving average modes to the timing display/error bars HUD element
- When on, arrow moving average is displayed above the error bars
- When on, bar moving average replaces the error bars with a moving bar
