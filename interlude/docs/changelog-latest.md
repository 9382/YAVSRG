Minor bug fixes and improvements update before I go home for Christmas
I will be organising myself over the holiday for hopefully many fast feature updates in early January :)

# Improvements
- Fixed behaviour of `:` in search boxes (was reserved for special behaviour I never added)
- options.json and config.json to protect them from system crashes (new system for storing data coming anyway)
- Small bit of audio no longer plays as songs switch when in endless mode
- Improved some animations on the main menu
- Improved the Interlude logo slightly, should be a little more aesthetically pleasing

# Endless mode
- Some small improvements to pattern analysis have been made. **You will have to re-run "Cache patterns" from Options > Advanced as this update wipes the existing cache**
- SV files are recommended if you are on an SV file, and not if you are not

# Offset changer
- Pressing CTRL+O while ingame is back, and brings up a manual offset picker. If you use Automatic Offset, you can still make manual changes with this
