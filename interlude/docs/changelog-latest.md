# New features
- NEW ingame overlay to find/search for players and view their profiles
	- Can be found in the top-right dropdown, hotkey is `F9` by default
	- In this overlay you can also change your name color and manage your friends list
- Added a prompt when dragging a Songs folder onto Interlude, to check if you want to link it rather than plain import
- Links in the ingame wiki are underlined

# Bug fixes
- Fixed transparency of noteskin previews on Import menu
- Fixed a bug causing the game to shut down twice, making it hang for a bit before closing

Also updated the wiki with some new pages :)
