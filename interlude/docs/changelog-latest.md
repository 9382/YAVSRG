Back on a bit of a roll with these patch releases

- Bug fix: Previews would get out of sync when changing audio rate
- But fix: You couldn't bind a hotkey to any of the navigation keys
- New feature: Judgement counts display
  This is turned off by default, go to Themes > Edit Theme > Gameplay config > Judgement counts > Enable to turn it on
