Separating the engine update from the stats update was a good idea
Thanks to those in the Discord (especially @Kori) for reporting various visual issues which are now fixed

# Bug fixes
- Fixed background being transparent with 100% background dim
- Fixed background being transparent during the loading transition to another image
- Fixed a visual issue with LN bodies on most skins
- (Hopefully) fixed issue where the game sometimes hangs when exiting

# UI Improvements
- Added a hotkey for the stats screen (Ctrl+J default)
- You can scrub through the chart preview and replays with scroll wheel
- You can pause the chart preview with Space or Middle Click (both rebindable)
- Pressing the mod menu hotkey (S default) while mods menu is open closes it again

# Skinning
- Default text for Early/Late meter has been changed from "Fast"/"Slow" to "Early"/"Late"
