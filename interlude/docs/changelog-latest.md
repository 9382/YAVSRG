Major engine and performance update

# Smart framerate cap
Introduced a new 'Smart' frame limit mode, replacing the old numerical caps.  
Likely to be DRASTICALLY better for both your GPU and your gameplay experience :)  
'Unlimited' frame cap is exactly the same as before, for you to compare the difference and see what works best for you

# Performance tools
You can check performance stats ingame by pressing CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F3  
CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F4 hides the debug performance bars that otherwise will lower your FPS

# Smoother chart loading
Switching charts should now be smooth (no lag spike) - Even on the most slow of hard drives  
This sounds small but was a massive engine undertaking, so keep an eye out for glitches and report any if you see them

# Other fixes/changes
- Imported osu! scores now have an icon to indicate they were imported
- Level select displayed LN % is affected by selected mods
- Fixed absolutely countless minor engine bugs while redoing how charts load
