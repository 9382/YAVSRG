# Improvements
- Some UI improvements for: changing gameplay binds, local scores list, online player list
- You can choose what OD/HP to use when exporting charts as .osz

- Pattern calculation has changed slightly again

# Bug fixes

- Fixed pacemaker not working if set to use your lamp PB, and your PB is NONE
- Rulesets with the same name no longer overwrite each other
- Fixed several bugs where switching rulesets in certain scenarios doesn't work
