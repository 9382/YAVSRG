0.7.8.3
====

The rare triple release in one day!

# Fixes in this patch
- Finally found and fixed the bug everyone was having with osu! score imports. **Should** now be working for everyone that experienced issues
- Right-click to clear search boxes (applies everywhere, not just level select)
- Fixed that awkward second and a half after searching where level select is fast scrolling to bring the results into view
