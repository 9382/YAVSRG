0.7.26
====

It's like a whole new game

# UI improvements
- Tooltips now show on mouse hover, rather than needing you to press /
- / shows tooltips for the keyboard-selected element, allowing you to use tooltips without a mouse
- Redesigned replay screen
- Score screen has been adjusted to look better
- Start of gameplay has a transition which shows song info + pacemaker info
- You can now type numbers into options menu sliders
- Menus apply a muffling effect to the song which I think is really cool

# Other features/improvements
- You can now edit rulesets ingame, it doesn't cover everything but it does cover the main things like colors and names. More coming soon
- Revamped skin textures so textures don't need accompanying .json files. Eliminates a bunch of common user mistakes :)
- Autoplay now shows input meter/some other HUD elements it didn't before
- CTRL+SHIFT+R skips the current song and immediately goes to the next suggestion

# Bug fixes
- Fixed more bugs with rulesets (osu! OD0 + EZ, Wife lamp colors)
- Fixed backtick character having no glyph
- Fixed some issues with LN tail rendering + scroll directions
- Fixed a parsing issue with osu! skin conversions
- Lots of other small things
