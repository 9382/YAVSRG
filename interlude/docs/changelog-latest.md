0.6.5.1
====

- Fixed bug in pacemakers targeting specific judgement counts
- "Save under-pace scores" setting now functions
- Fixed bug with auto-updater since 0.6.3 (you will have to manually install this version, sorry!)
  
To manually update an existing game, download the zip and extract the files over your Interlude folder.
When asked if you want to replace files, choose yes.

If you are on 0.6.2 or below the auto update should work fine, it was to do with the new build pipeline tech
