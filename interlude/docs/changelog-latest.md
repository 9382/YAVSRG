0.6.17

Something to tide you over while I work on server infrastructure

Accounts are no longer temporary and now is the time to grab your desired username
Early users get the permanent "early tester" badge which will show up on profiles later

# Other changes
- Some small UI adjustments (buttons now have yellow text on hover)
- The osu beatmap search has been improved with some new ways to sort and filter charts

As always please report bugs or anything that doesn't seem right quickly upon discovering it
(and thank you to those that are doing so already :)))
