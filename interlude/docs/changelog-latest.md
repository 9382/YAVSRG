0.6.6
====

- Fixed yet another bug in the auto updater
  It couldn't tell the difference between 0.6.5.1 and 0.6.5.2 so thought the game was up to date
  So I created this feature release (albeit small) that you can update to
  
- Added a changelog button to the main menu
  It reuses the ingame wiki feature to view the full Interlude changelog
  It turns yellow when an update is available
  
- Ingame wiki/changelog now has a button at the top to install updates
  You can also still update via the debug menu
  
- Added a Discord button the main menu. It links to the discord :)
