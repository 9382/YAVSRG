Bug fix update  
Remember that if something doesn't look right or isn't working, I will only know if you tell me in the Discord!

# Fixes in this release
- Fixed a crash when hitting the 'random chart' key with no charts visible
- Fixed background dim only being 254 opacity instead of 255
- Fixed some performance issues during gameplay, resulting in over 60% more FPS on my machine
- Fixed BPM and chart duration not updating when changing rates
- Fixed typo in context menu key name
- Fixed alphabetical ordering of level select groups putting all lowercase names last
- Improved an issue in Smart frame limit on fullscreen where some frames were rendered twice
- Probably more that I've forgotten about

# Other changes
- Watching a replay now takes you to the score screen afterwards
- Added a `timescale` console command for testing animations
