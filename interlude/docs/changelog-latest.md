### Interlude now runs on .NET 7

.Net Core 3.1 is out of lifetime support and it was surprisingly easy to make the upgrade 

This shouldn't mean anything for you, but if anything no longer works as it should please report the bug on discord

Also, windows releases of the game are now an all-in-one that contains the .NET 7 runtime. 
This makes the game and future updates about a 80mb download instead of 15mb, but bandwith/disk space is cheap and getting people to install a framework is not

#### Other changes

- The 'update available' message now reminds you that you can install it from ingame
- New feature: Column spacing as a noteskin setting
- Some hidden code for a secret feature I'm working on :)
