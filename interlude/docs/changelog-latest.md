Small update grindset

- New feature: Sound effects
  More will come from this in the future but for now I've brought back a familiar sound when launching the game :)
- "Bug fix: Favourite" rulesets as picked from the options screen now stay selected even when changing themes

Other improvements to rulesets:
- Ruleset switcher on level select now shows a selector instead of just cycling rulesets
- Switcher now appears on score screen and is how you switch rulesets there too
- In both cases the hotkey is D by default (you can no longer use arrow keys on the score screen)

More improvements to the ruleset stuff coming soon I just wanted to put this out for the bug fix
