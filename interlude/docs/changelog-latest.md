Another bug fix update to solve some fairly big bugs  
Big enough that I want to release it sooner, with another feature update probably on Tuesday

# Bugs fixed
- Improved security of account login tokens
- Drastically reduced CPU usage of the game engine in general (related to inputs)
- Fixed an issue in multiplayer that would mess up replay data + updated the multiplayer protocol with a better solution
- Fixed being able to use the jukebox to change songs from the multiplayer lobby screen
- Fixed being able to use the jukebox to change songs while playing (crashing the game)
- Fixed one last visual bug with local/online scores being blank depending on how you switch around the tabs

# Improvements
- You can now use `#sv` and `#nsv` in the search bar to respectively find SV and non-SV charts
- Gameplay binds and hotkeys now show up in search if you type 'keybinds' along with a few other related keywords
