Big feature update  
Let me know which new feature is your favourite

# Quaver support
- You can now import all your favourite Quaver charts into Interlude
- This includes mounting your library like for osu! and Etterna
- Negative SVs are supported!

If you find a bug with any Quaver conversions let me know in the Discord.

# Other features
- Added a jukebox in the bottom left of the toolbar that lets you pause and move forward/back through songs
- When on the main menu, the jukebox will cycle through songs when the previous one finishes
- Hotkey to go forward is R, Hotkey to go back is Shift+R and the jukebox is connected directly to the random suggestions system
- Shift+R takes you to the previous chart from before you pressed R, or previous charts from endless mode
- Added an option for the lane cover to be underneath your receptors, explosions and column lighting
- Exiting a song after playing more than 15 seconds is treated as "giving up" and shows you a score screen for your partial play
- Options menu now has a search box that lets you quickly search for settings

Whenever you expected a search to find something let me know, I will expand what keywords match to what settings over time.  

# Improvements
- Pattern breakdown is now shown under local scores for improved visibility
- If you only have 1 ruleset installed, the quick-switcher has a button to 'Get more rulesets' taking you to the import screen

# Bug fixes
- Fixed an error when recaching charts reported by Newson
- Fixed table suggestions UI being unviewable
- Fixed osu! charts with stacked notes converting to corrupt files (now they don't convert at all)

Enjoy!  
There may be a part 2 to this update later this bank holiday weekend, adding more features I've discussed in Discord
