Minor patch amidst the code organisation changes (it's keeping me on my toes)

# Improvements in this update
- Fixed a bug when selecting charts in a playlist while viewing said playlist in Collections view
- Added a little www.yavsrg.net watermark to the bottom left of score screens! Maybe I can reel some new people in that get curious when they see your score posts
