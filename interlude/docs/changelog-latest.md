Ooo new major version!
The major version is celebrate adding something the game has lacked for a while :)

# New features
- Something sounds different..
- Import screen's table tab now downloads table charts via YAVSRG's chart mirror system. Still experimental but feel free to try it out  
  It will become something prettier in a couple of weeks

# Improvements and fixes
- Screenshot callouts now stay on the screen for 5 seconds instead of 2
- Fixed minor graphical issues with LNs (not the bug on previews though that still exists)
- Fixed bug where charts imported from StepMania packs didn't track which pack they came from internally
- Some UI refactors and consistency improvements (see if you can spot the differences since last patch)
