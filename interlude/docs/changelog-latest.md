0.7.18.3
====

Thank you to all the new players who have given me plenty of feedback, bug reports and ideas

# Bug fixes
- Fixed several bugs in mouse interactions with some options menus
- Fixed color pickers overlapping with other components in some pages

# Improvements
- Improved appearance of Noteskins selection menu
- Improved appearance of previews in all options menus
- Prompt before exiting the game
- Some invisible UX fixes you won't even notice.. :)

# New features
- Explosion animations have received a rework! You can now do many more powerful and nicer looking things with them

Due to the explosion rework, column lighting and explosion animation speeds have been reset for all skins, you may need to set them again to your preference.
