0.7.24.7
====

I have honored several feature requests

# New stuff
- 'Receptor offset' setting in noteskins
- Added a 'KPS meter' option to the Input meter HUD element
- Rates up to 3.00x are now supported (previously went up to 2.00x)
- Sort by 'Date played'
- Click on the score screen graph to expand it
- Message shown when trying to reload skins in a menu, saying to close the menu first

# Improvements
- osu! Beatmap search is now powered by Mino which should work significantly better
- Fixed a bug when exporting certain charts to .osz
- Noteskin editing menu has been rearranged to make things easier to find
- Pacemaker HUD element updates its position more often

Those of you in the Discord that know about the skillset breakdown system I've been working on:  
You can now go to 'Skillsets' on the Stats page to snoop at your graphs and numbers, but you otherwise can't interact with it yet
