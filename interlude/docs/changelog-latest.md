## New stuff
- Rulesets are no longer part of themes. Instead, rulesets are saved in the new Rulesets folder.
  The game starts with only SC (J4) installed. You can add your favourite rulesets by going to Imports > Rulesets and using the
- New ingame downloader for rulesets
  This is where updates for rulesets will be distributed from now on (although it could be prettier)
  - osu! rulesets have been updated so that the lamp names are better and more useful
- There's no longer a reason to create your own theme (unless you want to try it out for fun) so I've relegated themes to the debug menu, and noteskin management is done from the Gameplay section of options
- Sliders in the options menus should be less annoying to use
  - Updated the precision at which most sliders naturally adjust by to sensible values
  - Hovering over the slider and scrolling with the mouse wheel allows sane adjustments
  - Tapping the arrow keys with the slider selected allows sane adjustments
- When adjusting HUD components in the options menu, you can now *hold down* the arrow keys to move things around
- Multiplayer is open to a slightly wider audience because you don't need to enable console commands to use it any more
- **PRACTICE MODE**
  This is a new screen available from level select (see the new target icon, hotkey is V)
  PRACTICE MODE allows you to play the current chart from a point of your choosing, for practice. There are hotkeys for pausing and retrying from the same point.
  While paused, you can receive suggestions on what scroll speed, hit position, visual offset or audio offset to use to compensate for how early or late you currently hit when you practice.
  I encourage you to try using this tool to sort out synchronisation issues and provide any feedback you might have!
  
  After a first round of testing this tool will also be available from multiplayer lobbies so that you can check your synchronisation on those pesky charts you've never played before
  
Also fixed a bug in the display of miss counts on the score screen

I hope you enjoy :)
