0.7.18.4

Dropping an update before I move house, containing even more stuff directly from user feedback this week

# Bug fixes
- Fixed hold explosions continuing forever if you start holding an LN and never release the key

# Improvements
- Explosion scale soft cap lifted from 200% to 500%
- Huge stride/improvement in pattern analysis and recommendation algorithm again
  You will have to recache patterns once again to use endless mode
- (Advanced) setting to disable the confirmation to exit the game

# New features
- Vertical offset setting for explosions, allowing for a little more flexibility in skinning
- (Advanced) setting to hold esc/ctrl R to exit/retry (for players with switches that rattle or keep accidentally bumping these keys)
- Column lighting technically now supports different images per column, customisation in-UI coming later
- Scroll speed setting shows approximate scroll speeds as they would be in other VSRGs
