0.7.18.5
====

I've mostly done internal code changes this week
To stick to the frequent release schedule I've been doing, here are some small things before those code changes pay off

# Bug fixes
- Watching a chart in auto-play mode no longer counts as "playing" it for the database/sort by recently played view
- Improved how LN bodies convert from osu! -> Interlude in many cases

# Skinning
- Improved automatic validation of noteskins under the hood
- Improved the osu! -> Interlude noteskin converter:
	- Option to convert arrow skins correctly
	- Converter attempts to convert stage-left and stage-right
	- Converter attempts to convert column lighting
- Improved guidance on the import screen towards importing your own osu! skin
- Can enable/disable stage textures in-game

# Endless mode
- Many changes under the hood that will pay off soon
- Playing a playlist has changed
	- Right click on the playlist or any song in it to play (instead of turning on endless mode and then playing)
	- New option to play it in a shuffled order
	
As usual stay tuned in the Discord for discussions and updates on what I'm working on next
