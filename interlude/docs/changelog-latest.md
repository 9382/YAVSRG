0.6.15.1
====

More fast releases based on bug reports and feature requests
There will be more stuff later today

## Bug fixes
- Personal best recalculation algorithm was counting NoSV scores towards personal bests when it shouldn't
- Changing noteskin didn't save for next time you open the game
- Fixed some hotkeys misbehaving on practice mode screen

## Improvements
- Search box (and some other things) now highlight in yellow when they are selected
- By request, practice mode calibration for scroll speed and hitposition is now possible even with audio turned on (even though I do not recommend this)

## Features
- Added gameplay setting presets
  These can be loaded and saved via Options > Gameplay
  Stores your scroll speed, hit position, upscroll setting, visual offset, noteskin and lane cover settings
