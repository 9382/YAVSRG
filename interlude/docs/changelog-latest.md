0.7.24.6
====

Some cool technical changes in this one, let me know in Discord if you experience any issues

# New stuff
- If you are on Windows, the Windows key is disabled during gameplay (so pressing it by mistake won't ruin your score)
- Console window is now hidden except when the game crashes
- High accuracies are formatted to more than 2 decimal places (i.e. accuracies between 99.98% and 100.00%)
- Score screen column filters now also affect the left-hand-side stats
- Added text to the Quick menu indicating the hotkey
- Standard Deviation line mode on score graph now scales to highest SD during the score

# Bugs fixed
- Etterna pack downloader updated to point to the new site (no longer beta.etternaonline)
- Timestamps on timelines have been adjusted to make more sense
- UI crashes no longer instant-quit the entire program, you can see the error message like you could a long time ago
- Fixed an issue with transparency + fading on the input meter

More cool features in the works, those of you snooping at code commits will know more than I let on in these changelogs for now
