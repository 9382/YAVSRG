Still on the UI improvement grindset, but also some new features :o

# UI improvements
- Improved the appearance of dropdowns, and dropdowns now correctly open with the right thing selected
- Game automatically retries connecting to the server (once) if disconnected
- Search bar in level select has been made slightly longer to look better
- Folders in level select are slimmer, have icons and show how many charts are in them

# New features
- You can change rates while paused in practice mode
- You can add charts to collections from the score screen (for endless mode users)
- You can play your playlists back-to-back by enabling endless mode and then playing a chart from your playlist in Collections view
