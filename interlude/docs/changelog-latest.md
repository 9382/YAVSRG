It's been a little while without an update, I've been looking into even more ways to improve how frames look on your monitor

# Even more engine improvements
- Reduced the file size of screenshots
- 'Smart' frame cap should look and work even better when on Windows (or running in WINE)
- Unlimited frame cap is Still the exact same as ever for people who prefer it
- Removed some debug messages

If you are running Interlude on your non-primary monitor you may see some issues in the new Smart frame cap, if so please report them in the discord
