0.7.15.2
====

I've messed around with how I organise Interlude's codebase again - Everything is now in a YAVSRG monorepo  
Hopefully this is yet another shift towards a convenient workflow for both me and anyone else interested in contributing to the codebase :o

This release will be the last one listed on the Interlude repo so your existing clients can correctly update to future versions

# Solitary bug fix in this release
- Fixed a race condition in the preview image caching of Imports > Noteskins
