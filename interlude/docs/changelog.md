Some bug fixes
Major refactor to UI (no visible changes)
Noteskin repository! Go to the imports screen to see the (at time of release) single noteskin that's available. Feel free to send me noteskins to be available there (I am also going to add some more soon)

0.5.15
====

- Hotkeys are now rebindable! See the Keybinds menu in Options
