# The basics

While you play a song, **notes** will scroll along **columns**, towards the **receptors** at the end.
When a note lines up with the receptors, press the corresponding button for that column.

There are also "hold notes" or "long notes" - For these notes you must press and hold the key for the column until the tail of the note reaches the receptor.

# Scoring

You are scored on your accuracy as you play, which is displayed as a percentage.  
The more accurately you timed your key press, the more points you get for each note.
