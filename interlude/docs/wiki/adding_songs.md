# Adding songs

To get more songs to play, visit the **Import** screen.

## Import songs you already have in other games

On the **Local imports** tab, you can link your existing song libraries from osu!mania, StepMania or Etterna.

> To save disk space, your .osu and .sm files will be converted to the .yav file format, but the game will still load the audio and background files from the original location.  
> This means if you later move or delete that game's songs folder, Interlude will no longer be able to find the audio or background files for them.

These links can be set up to automatically detect any new songs added to your linked games when you open Interlude.

## Import new songs from online

Via the **Etterna packs** tab you can search for and download Etterna community packs - They will automatically install when downloaded

## Import new songs from files/folders on your computer

You can also manually drag and drop .zips, folders, .osu files, .osz archives, etc onto your game window to install them.

# Tables

Not sure what to play? **Tables** are hand-picked sets of charts, organised by difficulty so you can progressively work up the level ladder and improve your skills.  
On the **Tables** tab in the import screen, you can download a table.

More details on how to use tables coming soon.. (ask in Discord for now)

Currently, the only existing table is Crescent, which has a wide selection of 4K charts to play
