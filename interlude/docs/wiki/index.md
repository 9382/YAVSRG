# Welcome to the Interlude Wiki!

This is the place to go for extended information on how a particular feature works.  

Always remember that **lots of information** is available directly from the game client by pressing `/` while hovering over buttons, settings, etc.  
If there is information available in this way, your **cursor will turn white!**

I will try my best to keep this Wiki up-to-date and relevant, if you see something that doesn't look quite right or you want more information about a particular feature then be sure to let me know [in the Discord](https://discord.gg/tA22tWR).
