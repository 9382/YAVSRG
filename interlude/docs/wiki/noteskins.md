# Noteskins

A **noteskin** is a collection of data files that customise how notes and the playfield look in-game.

Files you can find in a noteskin:  

- `.json` files containing config settings about sprites and the noteskin itself
- `.png` files which are used in-game as sprites

All sprites come with an accompanying `.json` file sharing the same name - This file holds information about the sprite, like how many animation frames it has

You can directly edit `.json` files with any text editor or notepad.  
You can directly edit `.png` files with any image editor (If you don't have one, some free options are [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)).

## What's in a noteskin?

- `noteskin.json` - Contains the core settings for the noteskin

You shouldn't need to edit `noteskin.json` settings directly, except in rare cases.  
All settings can be configured from the in-game settings menu, by going to Options > Noteskins > Edit noteskin, or by **pressing Ctrl+E**

## More documentation coming soon

Recent updates have redesigned the ingame noteskin editor to provide a lot more ingame explanation of how things work, so that you don't need to refer to the wiki.  
If you find something you don't understand or want a better explanation of, ask in the Discord server and the wiki may get updates as a result.
