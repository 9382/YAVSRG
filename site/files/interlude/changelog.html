Getting the wrong judgement loses a life
When you run out of lives, you missed out on the lamp!</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Special feature: Challenging scores!
To challenge a score, right click it in the scoreboard and select "Challenge"
This will make it a pacemaker as you play, and indicate if you are ahead or behind the existing score's pace
Being ahead/behind is updated based on the accuracy you had at that point in the chart (not final accuracy of that score)</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">To access pacemaker settings you can either:
- Configure them as before under Options &gt; Gameplay &gt; Pacemaker
- Configure them under the Mods menu in level select</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">The pacemaker must be turned on by you when you want to use it (it is not always on)
This is to make it something you declare to yourself you're going to do right before playing (a bit like using Sudden Death in osu!)
I'm interested in what effect this has:
- Maybe it will make you play better and focus properly
- Maybe it will be used to signify the end of warming up
- Maybe it will never get used because everyone will forget to turn it on</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.4</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">New features around user settings!</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Under Themes &gt; Edit Theme &gt; Gameplay Config you can now edit the position and other settings about gameplay widgets<ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Includes accuracy meter, combo meter, hit meter and more</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Includes tooltips explaining what things do</li></ul></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Added a color picker for screen covers, allowing you to change the color from ingame</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed several bugs with gameplay widgets that were discovered while putting these settings in</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can now do more theme stuff in-game (and see its effects quicker) instead of making manual edits in your theme folder</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.3.1</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">This release is a test of my automated publishing system :)</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Improved buttons on import screen mounts by moving them up slightly</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">You may also notice the release zip just has an exe, locale file and audio dll.
