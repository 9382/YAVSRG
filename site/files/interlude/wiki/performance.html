          <div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-3xl">Performance &amp; Framerate</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">VSRGs are a genre of game where <strong>performance truly matters</strong>.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">This page aims to explain what settings Interlude provides for performance and how they work, so you can decide what works best on your hardware.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Here are some terms this article uses and what they mean:
- <em>Frames</em> refer to each single image that gets sent to your screen - Tens or hundreds of frames are produced per second to make a moving image
- <em>Frame drops</em> are when the game misses a frame entirely - the notes stay still for a few frames and then jump further along the screen
- <em>Frame rate</em> is the number of frames produced by the game per second
- <em>Frame pacing</em> refers to how regular the interval between each frame being produced is (with consistency being good)
- <em>Visual latency</em> refers to how old the information in a frame is by the time it gets onto your screen</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can see some information about performance and frame times by pressing <code>CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F3</code> ingame.<br/><code>CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F4</code> hides/shows the frame time graph, since the graph lowers your frame rate :)</p><h2 class="text-3xl">Diagnose your problem</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4"><em>Frame drops</em> are when your game keeps missing frames.<br/>This will appear as short freezes and then the notes jumping to catch up with where they should be.<br/>'Smart' frame cap automatically tries to reduce these as much as possible.<br/>You can reduce these further by minimising background windows and not running anything else intense in the background on your computer (like another game).</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4"><em>Frame rate problems</em> are when your frame rate is too low, resulting in non-smooth motion.<br/>This is normally when the game cannot produce frames fast enough for the monitor.<br/>Most users should never experience this as most computers running Interlude can easily produce at least 10x as many frames per second as needed for the screen.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4"><em>Frame pacing problems</em> are when although enough frames are being shown per second, the information shown in each frame is not the same time interval apart.<br/>This results in notes jittering/not moving smoothly as they might move slightly further in one frame, then slightly less far in the next.<br/>If you are having this issue, <strong>you could try turning on the Anti-Jitter setting in Options &gt; System &gt; Performance &amp; Framerate</strong>.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4"><em>Visual latency problems</em> are when the frames displayed on your monitor are too out-of-date.<br/>If this is the case, after pressing a key you would see a significant lag before the screen actually updates in response to your input.<br/>To reduce the impact on your gameplay, you can compensate for visual latency by <strong>adjusting Visual Offset under Options &gt; System</strong>.<br/>If it is still too much, see the guide further down on using 'Unlimited' frame cap.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4"><strong>Please note:</strong> Visual latency doesn't mean that your inputs are going into the game with a delay, just that the effects show up on the screen with a delay.<br/>If you are actually experiencing significant <strong>input lag</strong>, where the game processes your inputs with a delay, please report this in the Discord.</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Using 'Unlimited' frame cap</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">If you are having problems with 'Smart' frame cap (such as particularly high visual latency), you can <em>entirely uncap the engine to produce as many frames per second as possible</em>.<br/>This should be used at your own risk as it can potentially make your graphics card hot as if running a much bigger game or system benchmark.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">If you have an NVIDIA graphics card you can add a frame cap in your graphics drivers to prevent the GPU getting as hot/using as much power, which I <strong>strongly recommend</strong>.<br/>Adding a frame cap directly in the drivers is far more effective than any frame cap I could code into the game engine.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Here's how:</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Open the start menu, find and open NVIDIA Control Panel</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">On the left hand sidebar, select 'Manage 3D settings'</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">On the 'Manage 3D Settings' page, switch to the 'Program Settings' tab</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Select Interlude.exe in the dropdown of what program to customise</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Find 'Max Frame Rate' and change it to On, 1000FPS (experiment with other values if you like)</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Click 'Apply' in the bottom right</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Now <strong>restart the game</strong> and switch to 'Unlimited' frame cap after restarting</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">If you don't have an NVIDIA graphics card you will have to figure out equivalent steps by Googling or asking in the Discord.</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Keyboard input</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Interlude checks for keyboard inputs as fast as possible in a background thread.<br/>Because of this, keyboard input in Interlude is <strong>almost entirely unrelated</strong> to your frame rate, and low frame rate does not mean the game polls your inputs slower.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Your keyboard should poll at 1000hz - If your keyboard goes higher that's a nice bonus but won't make a real difference.<br/>Your keyboard should NOT poll at 125hz - That is too slow and will lead to your taps being measured inaccurately!</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4"><a class="underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heZVmr9fyng">This video</a> has some good info on the topic, including how to tell if you're on 125hz.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">All in all as long as your keyboard polls at 1000hz (most gaming keyboards) you're good to go.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Often players will report render settings as causing "input lag" or "input latency", but this is not to do with your keyboard or how the game registers inputs.<br/>Normally, what is actually happening is <strong>visual latency</strong> from displaying frames that were rendered a few milliseconds ago - Your monitor is not yet showing the effect your keyboard input had!</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Streaming or recording the game</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You're probably using OBS.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">OBS captures frames directly from the game so it doesn't see the exact same thing the monitor sees.<br/>Because of this and how the game tries to sync with your monitor, you may see stuttering or glitching in your recorded video that you don't see on your monitor.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">I'm still looking into this and don't want to offer any misinformation, but what works for me is:</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Smart frame limit</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Borderless windowed mode</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">In OBS, use a 'Display Capture' instead of a 'Game Capture'</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">In OBS, right-click on the stream preview and <em>disable it</em></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Minimise the OBS window before recording, if convenient</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">With those settings I was able to record/stream perfectly smooth 60fps gameplay on my 60hz monitor without visual artifacts.</p></div>
