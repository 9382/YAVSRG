When you press the random key, it now just gives you an actually random chart by default</li></ul><h1 class="text-30">Bug fixes</h1><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Arrow key navigation in some menus is the most glitchless it's ever been</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed several crashes in the import screen</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed some crashes in the score screen graph</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed a crash in multiplayer if you quit out instantly after the round begins</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed a bug where the host could select mods just for them in multiplayer</li></ul></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.21</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">A few fixes and improvements</p><h1 class="text-30">New features</h1><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">The 'Graph Settings' button does something after all this time
You can now set a mode for a line graph to render, by default it shows your combo progression over time</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Game now tracks some stats like number of notes hit and your total playtime
This will become a screen you can look at eventually, for now it is hidden away in stats.json (and controls the session time display on the score screen)</li></ul><h1 class="text-30">Bug fixes</h1><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Options menu buttons will not select themselves just because the mouse is over them, only when you move the mouse yourself</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Scrolling in containers with the arrow keys is no longer janky</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Scrolling in containers with the mouse wheel is no longer janky</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">I've also been improving the secret pattern analyser and some of its reports will be showing in level select soon
You can currently see the output by enabling Printerlude and typing <code>patterns</code> in the console</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.20</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">More things you asked for</p><h1 class="text-30">'Vanishing notes' mode</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">LNs should also pass the receptors if not hit, and snap into the receptors when hit. They don't at the moment, this is a BUG
Unfortunately my render code is very old and delicate and I will need a big brain to fix this</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">I did however fix a bug with previews - All notes now look like they are being hit perfectly on previews</p><h1 class="text-30">Other bug fixes, improvements</h1><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">From now on, any newly cached charts will not break if the Interlude folder is moved somewhere else
Run Debug &gt; Rebuild cache in the options menu to apply this fix to your existing charts</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Optimised the level select screen. For very big open folders (10,000+) charts you should see double the framerate</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Optimised the 'What's new' screen. As changelogs piled up the screen was starting to run at about 30fps</li></ul><h1 class="text-30">New and improved: Progress meter</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Turns out peppy had it right all along, the best way to display chart progress is the familiar pie chart
The progress meter is now a pie chart, you can reposition it, change the size and colors, etc like the rest of the HUD</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">!! Existing users: You should click the 'Reset' button on the positioning for your Progress Meter as it will be using the old position of the falling dot</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.19</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Some requested features to make the engine feel a little more familiar (mostly for 4k players)
I won't go into too much detail because Discord has a 2000 character limit</p><h1 class="text-30">'Vanishing notes' setting</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Go to Debug &gt; Check this setting to make notes render like they do in Stepmania/similar engines
Hit notes will vanish and unhit notes will scroll past the receptors until they are hit or count as missed</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">4k players who play other games and have their reading directly tied to this visual cue, this may make you feel more at home
This is not enabled by default, you need to enable it!</p><h1 class="text-30">'Automatic sync' setting</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Go to Debug &gt; Check this setting to enable automatic sync
Local offset will be adjusted whenever you finish/restart a chart
This means you can retry the intro of a chart 1 or 2 times to sync it
For manual syncing tools, visit Practice mode</p><h1 class="text-30">'Prioritise low judges' setting</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Gameplay &gt; HUD &gt; Judgement Meter
When this setting is OFF (default, and this is new behaviour), the judgement meter always shows the most recent judge
When this setting is ON, the judgement meter shows the worst judgement in the last 500ms (or however long the fade time is set)</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You may find this less confusing and more familiar, even though it is objectively less useful IMO</p><h1 class="text-30">Other fixes</h1><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">You can make the bars thinner on hit meter, the minimum has changed from 5 pixels to 1 pixel</li></ul></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.18</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">A couple of bug fixes + progress towards table community workflow</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">If you have an Interlude account, there is a bot in the Discord that lets you search for songs and charts
This same database will power other things like getting a chart you don't have in multiplayer, and installing missing charts for tables</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">I've mostly been working on that but here are some changes to the client too</p><h1 class="text-30">Fixes and improvements</h1><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Trying to load a chart file that cannot be found on disk now shows a visible error message</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Added a 'Get more noteskins' button to the noteskins options menu, redirecting to the import screen</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">You can hit enter while previewing a song to play it (you don't have to close the preview first)</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">You can change the volume on options menus and while previewing a song</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Added a 'None' grouping method that shows all charts under one group</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed osu! songs search loading when the game starts up instead of when the page is visited for the first time</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">You can click on scores in multiplayer chat to see a score screen for them (let me know if you spot any bugs)</li></ul><h1 class="text-30">Tables</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Lots of things have changed about tables internally</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">There is no longer a console command to allow editing tables from in-game and this feature has been removed entirely</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">There is now a tab in the Imports screen for installing them (currently just Crescent, the 4k table, is available)</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Click to install tables</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Click again to attempt to install missing charts from various sources, using the aforementioned database (WIP and experimental)</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Hidden top secret feature: Right click on a table level in level select to see your average accuracy over all charts in that level</li></ul></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.17</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Something to tide you over while I work on server infrastructure</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Accounts are no longer temporary and now is the time to grab your desired username
Early users get the permanent "early tester" badge which will show up on profiles later</p><h1 class="text-30">Other changes</h1><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Some small UI adjustments (buttons now have yellow text on hover)</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">The osu beatmap search has been improved with some new ways to sort and filter charts</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">As always please report bugs or anything that doesn't seem right quickly upon discovering it
(and thank you to those that are doing so already :)))</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.16</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Multiplayer technical leaps</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">I'm testing out the new account registration system
You can now link an account to your Discord account and that account is how you log into Interlude</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">*<em>Please note: *</em> Accounts are currently temporary and get wiped whenever the server restarts
No data is held against them other than your Discord ID so try and break it/find bugs before I start storing data for real</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You have a couple weeks cause I'm going on holiday</p><h2 class="text-30">Features</h2><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">All online features (multiplayer lobbies) use end-to-end encryption</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Placeholder login where you 'claim' a name replaced with log in via discord</li></ul><h2 class="text-30">Other fixes/improvements</h2><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">The Interlude.exe icon might be back, I'm not really sure until it goes through the build pipeline</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">I've rewritten some major parts of Prelude, hence some time between releases to see if I spot any bugs
You may see some improvements in background image detection for .sm files and various metadata conversion fixes</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed a rare crash when interacting with osu! song search</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">osu! downloads use a different mirror (perhaps multiple mirror options coming soon)</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Some new menu splash messages</li></ul></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.15.3</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Features and changes that came directly from playtesters in the Discord

The game starts with only SC (J4) installed. You can add your favourite rulesets by going to Imports &gt; Rulesets and using the</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">New ingame downloader for rulesets

This is a new screen available from level select (see the new target icon, hotkey is V)
PRACTICE MODE allows you to play the current chart from a point of your choosing, for practice. There are hotkeys for pausing and retrying from the same point.
While paused, you can receive suggestions on what scroll speed, hit position, visual offset or audio offset to use to compensate for how early or late you currently hit when you practice.
I encourage you to try using this tool to sort out synchronisation issues and provide any feedback you might have!

After a first round of testing this tool will also be available from multiplayer lobbies so that you can check your synchronisation on those pesky charts you've never played before</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Also fixed a bug in the display of miss counts on the score screen</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">I hope you enjoy :)</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.13</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Stuff</p><h2 class="text-30">Fixes</h2><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Input overlay when watching replay now displays correctly on rates other than 1.0x</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Can now seek to before the audio file begins when previewing a chart</li></ul><h2 class="text-30">Improvements</h2><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Better warnings in the log when things go wrong with mounted imports and noteskins</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">osu! downloads via Import screen look better and should work on more charts thanks to Nerinyan.moe</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Noteskin downloads via Import screen look better</li></ul><h2 class="text-30">Changes</h2><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">"Gameplay widgets" have been removed from themes.

Getting the wrong judgement loses a life
When you run out of lives, you missed out on the lamp!</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Special feature: Challenging scores!
To challenge a score, right click it in the scoreboard and select "Challenge"
This will make it a pacemaker as you play, and indicate if you are ahead or behind the existing score's pace
Being ahead/behind is updated based on the accuracy you had at that point in the chart (not final accuracy of that score)</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">To access pacemaker settings you can either:
- Configure them as before under Options &gt; Gameplay &gt; Pacemaker
- Configure them under the Mods menu in level select</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">The pacemaker must be turned on by you when you want to use it (it is not always on)
This is to make it something you declare to yourself you're going to do right before playing (a bit like using Sudden Death in osu!)
I'm interested in what effect this has:
- Maybe it will make you play better and focus properly
- Maybe it will be used to signify the end of warming up
- Maybe it will never get used because everyone will forget to turn it on</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.4</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">New features around user settings!</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Under Themes &gt; Edit Theme &gt; Gameplay Config you can now edit the position and other settings about gameplay widgets<ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Includes accuracy meter, combo meter, hit meter and more</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Includes tooltips explaining what things do</li></ul></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Added a color picker for screen covers, allowing you to change the color from ingame</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed several bugs with gameplay widgets that were discovered while putting these settings in</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can now do more theme stuff in-game (and see its effects quicker) instead of making manual edits in your theme folder</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">0.6.3.1</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">This release is a test of my automated publishing system :)</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Improved buttons on import screen mounts by moving them up slightly</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">You may also notice the release zip just has an exe, locale file and audio dll.
