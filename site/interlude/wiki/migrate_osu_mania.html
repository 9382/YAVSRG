        <!-- content -->
        <div class="w-full p-10 space-y-8">
          <div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-30">Migrating from osu!mania</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Already play osu!mania? This guide will walk you through migrating most of your data to Interlude.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">If you encounter any bugs or things that don't look right, feel free to ask in the Discord server.</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-30">Step 1: Songs</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">On the Import screen, there is a tool for linking your existing osu! Songs library to Interlude.<br/>It will first try to auto detect the folder, but if that doesn't work you can just link by dropping your osu! <strong>'Songs' folder</strong> onto the Interlude window <strong>when the menu asks you to.</strong></p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">By linking your libraries instead of fully importing them, audio files and background images are not copied, so the Interlude version of the song library should only be a few MB (saves on drive space if you play both). There is also an option to automatically import newly added charts whenever Interlude launches.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Note: <em>if you drop your osu! Songs folder onto the game normally (not using the linking menu), it will import them all without linking (copying audio files and all), which may not be what you wanted</em></p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">It may take a few minutes to complete the import, but it will work in the background and you can play what songs have already been imported.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can also download new osu! Beatmaps ingame via the Import screen.</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-30">Step 2: Scores</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Once the import for your osu! Songs has completed, you can click 'Manage' on the osu! link panel.<br/>From there you will see an option to import your osu! scores to Interlude!</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Again this will run in the background and may take a few minutes.</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-30">Step 3: Noteskins</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can drag an existing osu! skin (as either a .osk file, or the folder from osu!/Skins) onto the game window.<br/>The game will prompt you for which keymode to import, and then try its best to convert the skin to a matching Interlude noteskin.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">This feature is still under construction and needs some major improvements, but it should work for many popular skins or at least jump-start some manual edits to make the skin work.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Alternatively, there are noteskins available for download from the Import screen - If you use a common skin it may already be there!</p></div><div class="frame text-20 container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-30">Step 4: Scroll speed and audio sync</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">It's hard to conveniently convert your osu!mania scroll speed to Interlude, so I recommend eyeballing it. I use 220% on Interlude and 28-30 on osu!mania.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">On the Level select menu, you can open Practice mode to play a section of the selected song and the game will suggest adjustments to your scroll speed, hitposition, audio offset and visual offset.<br/>If you're used to another game, you should adjust all offsets with the game audio muted at first, and then change audio offset last.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Suggested order to make changes:</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Mute game audio while playing a section of a chart in practice mode</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Once scroll speed looks right to you, adjusting hitposition until it looks right</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Once hitposition looks right to you, adjust visual offset if needed</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Unmute game audio and continue playing to adjust audio offset as needed</li></ul></div>
